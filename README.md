# code_snippet_repo_1
Looking to improve my "code ninja" skills. Record my snippets and track over time. I realize a lot of these have to be refactored, and 
currently too verbose. However, the key for me at this point is to just get something workable and "decent" written in a timely manner. 
A lot of these are from code challenges and other such activities. Hope to have more than 100 of these in a few months or so.
